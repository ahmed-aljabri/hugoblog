I'm Ahmed, currently a graduate student at the University of Cambridge pursing an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science. My main interests are in network architecture, protocol engineering, privacy and secure programming.

The intention behind this site is to act as a portfolio site and also share a personal blog covering technologies I find interesting. You may also find posts discussing ideas and designs for some of my software projects on github.

> **Disclaimer: This blog isn't an authoritative source, nor do I claim to be an expert on the topics I write about. It's simply where I reflect on ideas, document things I learn, and sometimes challenge conventional thinking in networking and systems design. The ideas and views put forward in this site do not represent any of the organizations I work with.** 

Any comments/thoughts whether you agree or disagree with what I write is more than welcome.

You can contact me at: ahmedaljabriedu (at) gmail.com
