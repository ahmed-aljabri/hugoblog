My name is Ahmed Al-Jabri, in recent years I completed degrees in Computer Science & Cybersecurity. My main areas of interest are Computer Systems and Networking, Distributed Systems and Secure Programming.<br>

The intention behind this site is to host a personal blog which will cover a range of technologies, share my thoughts and present technological deep-dives on various topics of interest. You might also find posts discussing ideas and designs for some of my software projects on github.
